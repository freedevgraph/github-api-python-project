# GitHub API Python Project

This is a simple Python project that demonstrates how to interact with the GitHub API using the `PyGithub` library.

## Features
- Authenticates with a GitHub Personal Access Token.
- Lists all repositories accessible by the authenticated user.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/freedevgraph/github-api-python-project.git
    cd github-api-python-project
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up your GitHub Personal Access Token:**
    The script expects your GitHub Personal Access Token to be set as an environment variable named `GH_TOKEN`.
    You can generate a new token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
    Make sure the token has at least `repo` scope to list private repositories.

    ```bash
    export GH_TOKEN="YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"
    ```

4.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

Upon running the script, it will print the login of the authenticated user and then list the names of all repositories associated with that user.
